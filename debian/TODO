TODO list for Debian wmaker package
===================================

* Clean the mess in debian/rules, split it maybe, make a
  debian/patches directory, read xfree's or libc6's debian/rules
* Fix the upgrade script (translate it to perl, use getpwent to go
  thru the entire list of users, read /etc/login.defs to figure out
  which id's are "regular" users)
* fix the "depends on version just built" problem.  Look for some
  package that gets this right; asked on -mentors, but there was no
  reply.
